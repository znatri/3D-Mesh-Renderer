# Geodesic Surface Modification with Triangle Subdivision

This project is a Python program that reads in polyhedral models and creates geodesic surfaces using triangle subdivision. The program also provides a visualization of corner operations such as next, 
opposite and swing. All of the mesh objects that are created and modified are composed of only triangles.

## Prerequisites

This program requires the following:
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Processing 3.x](https://processing.org/download/)

## Installation

To install this program, download the source code from the GitHub repository. Once the code is downloaded, open the file in Processing and run it.

## Usage

The program will prompt the user for an input file for the polyhedral model. The user will then be able to modify the model using the triangle subdivision technique. The program also has a visualization of 
corner operations such as next, opposite, and swing.
